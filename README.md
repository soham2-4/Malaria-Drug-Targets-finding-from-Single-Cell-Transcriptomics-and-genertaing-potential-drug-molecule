# Computational approach for decoding Malaria Drug targets from Single-Cell Transcriptomics and finding potential drug molecules.

Datasets: Three datasets are given in the Datasets folder. 

Data preprocessing: The datasets given in this repository are preprocessed. We have collected raw datasets from three papers(details in the paper). Then, we preprocessed these datasets to get a meaningful representation of our work.

Feature selection using mutual-information-based feature reduction technique: 'without_featureselection.py' can be used to get the classification results before feature selection. 'MI_feature_reduction.py' can be used to get the classification result after selecting features using Mutual information-based feature selection.
