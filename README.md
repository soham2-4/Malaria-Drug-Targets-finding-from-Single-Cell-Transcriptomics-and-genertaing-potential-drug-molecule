# Computational approach for decoding Malaria Drug targets from Single-Cell Transcriptomics and finding potential drug molecules.

Datasets: Three datasets are given in the Datasets folder. 

Data preprocessing: The datasets given in this repository are preprocessed. We have collected raw datasets from three papers(details in the paper). Then, we preprocessed these datasets to get a meaningful representation of our work.

feature selection using mutual-information-based feature reduction technique:

Protein-protein interaction network analysis:

Crucial proteins:

Suggested drug molecules using Targetdiff:

ADMET and druglikeliness:
