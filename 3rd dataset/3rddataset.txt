output260.txt is the selected feature from 3rd dataset, which can be found in the 'selected feature and analysis' folder. 
After getting selected features, we did PPI analysis. you can find results in an excel sheet named 260f.xltx in the 'selected feature and analysis' folder.
1stp.pdb, 2ndp.pdb, 3rdp.pdb, 4thprotein.pdb are the crucial proteins found from PPI analysis.
this_cavity_1_2ndp.pdb, this_cavity_2_2ndp.pdb, this_cavity_3_2ndp.pdb, this_cavity_4_2ndp.pdb, this_cavity_5_2ndp.pdb are the strong binding site of the 2nd protein. Other crucial proteins do not have strong binding sites of relevant biological function for plasmodium survival.
All the drugs that have been generated for these five strong binding sites can be found in drugs for binding sites folder.
All the ADMET and drug likeliness analysis can be found in ADMET and swissadme analysis folder. We have used some criteria to select potential drug molecules from these generated drugs; one can find all the details in our paper.
